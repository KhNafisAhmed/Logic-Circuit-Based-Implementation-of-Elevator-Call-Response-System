Elevator responds to calls based on priorities. Suppose, an elevator in currently on the third floor and going upward, and it has two calls to respond - one from floor 5 (downward), and another from floor 2 (downward). It will respond to the call of 5th floor first, since it is going upward. Similarly, all other floors has a priority queue to maintain based on their moving direction, and direction of the floor called. In this project, elevator call response system for a 5-storied building is implemented using priority encoders and logic gates.
